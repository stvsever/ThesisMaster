Create the Step-05 HAPA-based digital intervention plan from this evidence bundle:

EVIDENCE_BUNDLE_JSON:
$EVIDENCE_BUNDLE_JSON

Important:
- The final intervention must explicitly connect selected targets, barrier domains, and coping strategies.
- The plan must remain implementable in a digital health setting.
- Include one user-facing personalized intervention message.
- Ensure the phased HAPA plan is detailed, practical, and coherent with the data.
- If critic_feedback is present, revise weak areas explicitly while preserving valid parts of the prior proposal.
