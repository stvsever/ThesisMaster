TIME AXIS
- n_timepoints: 180
- freq (base axis): D  (measurement schedules may enforce extra missingness)
- start_date: 2025-01-01

REGIME SHIFT (Patterns 4 & 5)
- center (t_norm): 0.5029
- abrupt step: activates at t >= center
- smooth transition: sigmoid around center (width ~0.04 in t_norm)

LATENT DRIVERS
- stress: AR(1) + smooth shift + weekly sinusoid + drift + pulses
- sleep_disruption: AR(1) + improvement after shift + weekly sinusoid + drift + pulses

SHARED CO-FLUCTUATION (Pattern 6)
- shared_osc: sin(2π * 1.00 * t + phase=3.80)

PULSES / EVENTS (Pattern 8)
- number_of_pulses: 2
  * pulse_1: start_idx=30, length=6, amp=0.872
  * pulse_2: start_idx=89, length=3, amp=1.134

CROSS-VARIABLE EFFECTS (Pattern 7)
- driver_predictor_code (regime-dependent effect): P02
- criteria receive lagged predictor influence via lags [2,4,7] (weights [0.50,0.35,0.15])

MISSINGNESS (Pattern 10)
- MCAR + MAR(stress-related) + block-missing + measurement schedule (freq hints)
- realized missingness rates by code:
  * P01: missing_rate=0.211 | freq_hint=None
  * P02: missing_rate=0.150 | freq_hint=None
  * P03: missing_rate=0.122 | freq_hint=None
  * P04: missing_rate=0.056 | freq_hint=None
  * P05: missing_rate=0.144 | freq_hint=None
  * P06: missing_rate=0.122 | freq_hint=None
  * P07: missing_rate=0.206 | freq_hint=None
  * P08: missing_rate=0.172 | freq_hint=None
  * C01: missing_rate=0.156 | freq_hint=None
  * C02: missing_rate=0.261 | freq_hint=None
  * C03: missing_rate=0.067 | freq_hint=None
  * C04: missing_rate=0.072 | freq_hint=None
  * C05: missing_rate=0.172 | freq_hint=None
  * C06: missing_rate=0.328 | freq_hint=None
