# MASTERPROEF

Private research repository for the Master's thesis project of **Stijn Van Severen** at **Ghent University**.

## Academic Context

- Institution: Ghent University
- Thesis Type: Master's Thesis
- Author: Stijn Van Severen
- Supervisors: Geert Crombez, Annick De Paepe

## Project Scope

This repository contains the development work, ontology engineering, agentic framework scripts, evaluation pipelines, and analysis components for a thesis focused on personalized mental health optimization workflows.

The codebase currently includes:

- `SystemComponents/PHOENIX_ontology`: ontology generation and aggregation scripts (CRITERION, PREDICTOR, PERSON, CONTEXT, HAPA).
- `SystemComponents/Agentic_Framework`: operationalization and initial observation model construction modules.
- `SystemComponents/Hierarchical_Updating_Algorithm`: readiness checks, time-series/network analysis, and momentary impact quantification.
- `Evaluation`: pseudoprofiles, intermediate outputs, and experiment artifacts.
- `utils`: supporting utilities for clustering, mappings, feasibility scoring, migration checks, and analyses.

## Repository Status

This project is under active thesis development and currently maintained as a private repository.

## Data and Artifact Policy

At the request of the author, this GitHub repository excludes large generated artifacts and heavyweight binaries (for example, generated plots, cached arrays, intermediate `results/` folders, and large ontology export files such as `.owl` outputs).

These files may exist in the local research workspace for reproducibility and analysis, but they are intentionally not pushed to GitHub.
