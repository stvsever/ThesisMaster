# Agentic Core Utilities

Shared runtime assets for PHOENIX agentic stages.

## Contents

- `shared/`: contracts, LLM runtime, guardrails, feasibility helpers, fusion utilities.
- `prompts/`: centralized prompt templates and manifest.

## Rationale

This folder centralizes reusable agentic infrastructure so `src/SystemComponents/Agentic_Framework/` remains focused on stage modules (`01` to `05`).
