# Compatibility: legacy Step-05 path

This directory is kept for backward compatibility only.

- Canonical updated-model cycle logic moved to:
  - `src/SystemComponents/Agentic_Framework/04_ConstructionUpdatedObservationModel/`
- `01_run_updated_model_cycle.py` here is a compatibility wrapper.

Use the canonical Step-04 path for new development.
