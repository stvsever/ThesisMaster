# `src/` — Core PHOENIX Engine Code

This directory contains the implementation code for the thesis engine.

## Structure

- `SystemComponents/`
  - `Agentic_Framework/`
  - `Hierarchical_Updating_Algorithm/`
  - `PHOENIX_ontology/` (ontology content kept unchanged)
- `utils/`
  - official utilities, ontology mappings, and exploratory helpers

## Compatibility

Root-level symlinks (`SystemComponents`, `utils`) are intentionally preserved so existing scripts and historical paths continue to work without function loss.
