SUMMARY
- 100 realistic, app-style free-text context descriptions (internal + external) intended to test mapping to a broad contextual ontology.
- Each entry blends longer-horizon context (e.g., upbringing, housing stability, work pattern, caregiving load, chronic constraints) with momentary “right now” context (place, time, social setting, task demands, device/digital load, body signals, energy).
- Only a subset includes explicit {AUTO_QUERY: ...} blocks to simulate sensor/API-enriched context (weather, AQI, commute, calendar, device state).
- Focus is on context (what’s happening around/within me), not on diagnostic labels; language stays everyday and varies in tone, spelling, and detail.

pseudoprofile_context_ID001
I grew up in a house where mornings were chaotic (lots of shouting, rushing), so “quiet mornings” still feel unfamiliar. Right now it’s 06:35, kitchen, dim winter light. Kettle boiling, keys missing again. I feel alert-but-fragile, like one more thing going wrong will tip the day.

pseudoprofile_context_ID002
Living in a studio means there’s no real “off switch” from work. 22:10, laptop on the same table where I eat. I can hear neighbors through the wall and my shoulders keep creeping up. I keep reopening the same doc even though my brain is sliding.

pseudoprofile_context_ID003
Since moving cities last year, my routines are still kind of patched together. 17:05, walking past a busy intersection, lots of scooter noise and exhaust smell. I’m trying to remember if I paid the electricity bill. My head feels scattered, like tabs open.

pseudoprofile_context_ID004
I’m usually the “responsible one” in my family, so I’m the default problem-solver. Right now I’m in a hospital corridor, 13:20, waiting for an update. Fluorescent lighting, vending machine hum, people speaking softly. My stomach is hollow even though I ate.

pseudoprofile_context_ID005
Background: raised in a small town where everyone knew everyone, so crowded anonymous places still feel weirdly unsafe. Now: 08:15, metro, packed carriage, someone’s backpack pressing into me. I’m holding a pole with one hand and my phone with the other, trying not to drop anything.

pseudoprofile_context_ID006
I’ve been on rotating shifts for years, so my “sleep schedule” is basically a suggestion. It’s 03:40, break room, cheap coffee, microwaved smell. Body feels heavy but my mind is oddly sharp. I’m watching the clock like it’s a sport.

pseudoprofile_context_ID007
My apartment has damp issues (landlord keeps saying it’s “normal”), so I’m always checking for that musty smell. 10:55, home office corner by the window. It’s humid inside and my throat feels scratchy. I’m trying to work but I keep getting up to open/close the window.

pseudoprofile_context_ID008
Long-term: I’ve been caring for my dad on and off, so my calendar is never fully mine. Right now 19:30, sitting in the car outside his place, engine off. I’m rehearsing what I need to ask the nurse. Phone battery low, and that weird low-battery panic kicks in.

pseudoprofile_context_ID009
Grew up bilingual and still switch languages depending on who I’m with. 12:05, cafeteria at work, half the table is speaking one language and the other half another. I’m nodding a lot and mentally translating, which is tiring in a sneaky way.

pseudoprofile_context_ID010
I’ve always lived paycheck-to-paycheck, so “normal expenses” feel like threats. 16:50, kitchen table, bills and receipts spread out. I’m doing mental math and my jaw is tight. The room is warm but my hands feel cold.

pseudoprofile_context_ID011
Background: I share custody, so every other week is “kid week” and everything is louder. Now it’s 07:10, cereal bowls, backpacks, shoes everywhere. I’m trying to pack lunches while answering a school email. My attention is in pieces.

pseudoprofile_context_ID012
I work in a job where people expect instant replies, and it trained my brain to flinch at notifications. 09:05, open-plan office, Slack pinging, calendar reminders stacking. I’m sitting upright like I’m bracing. Coffee hasn’t even hit yet.

pseudoprofile_context_ID013
I grew up in a very quiet home, so city noise feels like constant friction. 21:45, street outside my building, motorcycles revving. I’m carrying groceries and my arms are tired. I’m thinking about the stairs and wishing I lived on the ground floor.

pseudoprofile_context_ID014
My last relationship ended after a long “walking on eggshells” phase, so tension in rooms registers fast. Right now 18:25, friend’s apartment, group dinner. Everyone’s laughing but there’s a small vibe shift and my body noticed before my brain did.

pseudoprofile_context_ID015
I’m in grad school part-time while working, so my life is mostly deadlines. 23:55, desk lamp on, notes everywhere. I’m trying to read but words are sliding. I keep checking the clock and doing the “how many hours left” math.

pseudoprofile_context_ID016
{AUTO_QUERY: weather(current_temp, humidity, precip_prob) via location}
{AUTO_QUERY: daylight(sunrise, sunset)}
It’s 14:10 and I’m on a bench outside the clinic. Air feels damp, light is flat. I can feel my shoulders drop a bit just being outdoors, but I’m also watching the door because I don’t want to miss my name being called.

pseudoprofile_context_ID017
Background: grew up with financial instability, so I over-prepare (spares of everything). Now 07:55, bus stop, I’m early again. Backpack has charger, snack, umbrella. I’m calm-ish, but there’s a constant “what if” hum under it.

pseudoprofile_context_ID018
I rent a room in shared housing, so privacy is a resource. 20:40, standing in the hallway waiting for the bathroom. I can hear people talking behind doors. I’m tired and just want ten minutes alone, but the house feels crowded.

pseudoprofile_context_ID019
My work is mostly emotional labor (people come to me with problems). 15:30, after a long call, I’m staring at my screen and my face feels frozen in “polite listening.” I want silence but my phone keeps buzzing.

pseudoprofile_context_ID020
Long-term: I have a long commute that eats my day. Now 06:25, train platform, cold air, hands in pockets. The train is delayed again. I can feel irritation building and I’m trying not to start the morning already angry.

pseudoprofile_context_ID021
{AUTO_QUERY: device(battery_percent, connectivity, do_not_disturb)}
01:20, in bed, phone brightness low. The Wi‑Fi is lagging and pages keep loading slowly. I’m half-asleep but every buffer wheel makes me more awake. My body wants rest, the screen keeps me hooked.

pseudoprofile_context_ID022
Background: grew up in a noisy apartment above a bar, so I’m used to sleep in chaos. Now I’m staying in a quiet guest room, 22:30, and the silence is almost too loud. I notice every tiny sound: radiator tick, distant car, my own breathing.

pseudoprofile_context_ID023
I’m usually outdoors a lot in summer, but winter here means I barely see daylight. 08:05, getting dressed in a dim room, sky still grey. I feel slower than I want to. Everything takes more effort, like moving through thick air.

pseudoprofile_context_ID024
Background: my family doesn’t do direct conflict, so I learned to “smooth things over.” Right now 19:10, at home, partner is quiet in the other room. I’m doing dishes loudly on purpose, hoping it starts a conversation without starting a fight.

pseudoprofile_context_ID025
{AUTO_QUERY: weather(wind_speed, feels_like_temp)}
17:45, cycling home into headwind. Legs are burning, cheeks cold, eyes watering. I’m annoyed at the wind like it’s personal. Traffic is loud and I keep double-checking cars at intersections.

pseudoprofile_context_ID026
I’ve been freelancing, so work and money are lumpy. 11:15, café, laptop open, I’m pretending I’m “working” but I’m also watching how many coffees I can justify buying. It’s noisy and my focus keeps slipping.

pseudoprofile_context_ID027
Background: I’m the first in my family to go to university, so I feel like I’m always “catching up.” 10:00, lecture hall, people typing fast. I’m taking notes but also checking if I look like I belong here.

pseudoprofile_context_ID028
I live near a construction site, so mornings start with drilling. 07:30, lying in bed with the sound of banging through the wall. I’m not even fully awake and my body already feels tense.

pseudoprofile_context_ID029
My job is mostly on calls, so my day is measured in tiny boxes on a calendar. 16:55, 5 minutes between meetings. I’m in the bathroom, washing hands, trying to reset my face. I can hear the next call starting in my head already.

pseudoprofile_context_ID030
Background: grew up with a parent who was sick, so hospitals and “waiting” are familiar. Now 09:40, waiting room, smell of disinfectant. My knee is bouncing. I’m scrolling to pass time but not really reading anything.

pseudoprofile_context_ID031
{AUTO_QUERY: air_quality(AQI, PM25) via location}
13:05, walking to lunch. The air feels gritty, like it’s sticking in my throat. Sun is bright but the sky looks hazy. I’m thinking about whether to take the longer route through the park.

pseudoprofile_context_ID032
My apartment is tiny but it’s the first place that’s mine. 18:20, I’m cooking with one foot in the living room and one in the kitchen. Pan sizzling, windows fogging. I feel cozy and cramped at the same time.

pseudoprofile_context_ID033
Background: I’ve moved a lot, so I never fully unpack emotionally. Right now 21:00, new neighborhood, walking the same block again because I’m still learning where everything is. Streetlights, unfamiliar noises, and I keep checking maps.

pseudoprofile_context_ID034
I work in healthcare support, so my schedule changes last minute. 05:50, alarm went off, I’m already dressed. Bag packed with snacks and spare socks. I feel prepared but also like my life isn’t quite mine.

pseudoprofile_context_ID035
Background: grew up with strict rules, so I still feel weird breaking routine. Now 14:30, I took a “random” afternoon off. I’m sitting by the window with tea, but my brain keeps insisting I should be doing something “productive.”

pseudoprofile_context_ID036
I live with chronic back stiffness, so chairs matter more than they should. 10:25, coworking space, the chair is too low and my shoulders are creeping up. I keep shifting positions and losing my train of thought.

pseudoprofile_context_ID037
{AUTO_QUERY: commute(next_departure, delay_minutes)}
07:12, platform. App says delay +12 minutes. My hands are cold, coffee is lukewarm, and I’m mentally renegotiating my whole morning timeline. People around me look half-asleep and irritated.

pseudoprofile_context_ID038
Background: I grew up with a lot of caretaking responsibilities, so rest feels “earned.” Now 12:55, lunch break, sitting alone outside. Sun on my face, food in my lap. I’m trying to just sit without turning it into a task.

pseudoprofile_context_ID039
I’m in a small apartment with a loud neighbor who plays bass-heavy music. 23:30, trying to read in bed. The wall is vibrating lightly. I keep pausing to see if it stops, then it starts again.

pseudoprofile_context_ID040
Background: I’ve had a long-term “always on” job, so weekends feel like catch-up time not rest time. Saturday 11:20, laundry spinning, email open “just for a second.” I’m telling myself it’s fine while my shoulders climb.

pseudoprofile_context_ID041
I share a car with my partner, so planning is constant. 08:40, sitting in the driver’s seat, adjusting mirrors. I’m running through the day: drop-off, pick-up, groceries. It’s like my brain is a logistics spreadsheet.

pseudoprofile_context_ID042
{AUTO_QUERY: weather(precip_intensity, wind_gust)}
15:15, walking home in drizzle that’s not quite rain. Umbrella keeps flipping in gusts. Socks damp. I’m annoyed but also weirdly calm because it forces me to slow down.

pseudoprofile_context_ID043
Background: I grew up around smokers, so the smell of cigarettes still snaps my attention. Now 19:05, outside a bar waiting for a friend. Smoke drifting past. I’m leaning away, pretending I’m just checking my phone.

pseudoprofile_context_ID044
I’m doing night classes, so evenings are structured. 18:10, bus to campus, crowded aisle, backpacks everywhere. I’m revising notes on my phone but it’s hard to focus with people bumping me.

pseudoprofile_context_ID045
Background: I’ve been through multiple layoffs in past jobs, so uncertainty sticks. 09:50, office, someone said “big changes soon.” Now every email feels like it could be “the one.” I’m trying to work but my attention keeps snapping to the inbox.

pseudoprofile_context_ID046
It’s my first winter living alone. 21:35, apartment is quiet, heater clicking. I’m eating dinner standing up in the kitchen because sitting down feels too still. I keep starting and stopping random chores.

pseudoprofile_context_ID047
{AUTO_QUERY: device(screen_time_today, notifications_last_hour)}
13:40, I’m on the couch “for a minute” but my screen time is ridiculous. I keep toggling apps like I’m searching for something to land on. The room is bright outside but the curtains are half closed.

pseudoprofile_context_ID048
Background: growing up, food was sometimes scarce, so I still hoard pantry items. 18:00, grocery store, I’m comparing prices and doing mental arithmetic. The aisles are loud and I keep losing my list.

pseudoprofile_context_ID049
I have a standing weekly call with family, so Sundays feel like performance. 17:30, I’m tidying the background for video. I’m checking lighting like it matters. I can feel myself rehearsing “I’m fine” in advance.

pseudoprofile_context_ID050
Background: I grew up in the countryside, so I miss open space. Now 12:20, city center, lots of sirens and footsteps. I’m walking fast to get through it. I feel like my body wants a horizon.

pseudoprofile_context_ID051
I’m on a tight budget, so pharmacy trips are stressful. 16:25, in line, holding a prescription slip. I’m counting money in my head. The room is warm, people close, and I’m trying to look casual.

pseudoprofile_context_ID052
{AUTO_QUERY: weather(current_temp); {AUTO_QUERY: indoor(sensor_CO2?) if available}}
14:45, working from home. The air feels stale and I’m yawning a lot. I opened the window but it’s cold outside, so now I’m half freezing and half sleepy. I can’t find the “comfortable zone.”

pseudoprofile_context_ID053
Background: my parents fought quietly (cold silence), so silence still feels loaded. Now 20:50, at home, partner hasn’t said much all evening. TV is on but low. I’m doing small tasks just to fill the space.

pseudoprofile_context_ID054
I’m traveling for work this month, so everything feels temporary. 23:10, hotel room, unfamiliar pillow, AC humming. I laid out tomorrow’s clothes like I’m in the military. My suitcase is still half open.

pseudoprofile_context_ID055
{AUTO_QUERY: calendar(next_event_time, location)}
08:20, outside an office building I don’t usually go to. I’m early and it’s awkward. I keep checking the calendar invite like the address might change. My hands are cold from holding iced coffee anyway.

pseudoprofile_context_ID056
Background: I had a long-term roommate situation that was tense, so shared kitchens still feel like “territory.” Now 19:00, shared apartment kitchen, someone else left dishes. I’m trying to cook quietly and not be “that person.”

pseudoprofile_context_ID057
I’ve been trying to save money, so I’m avoiding going out. Friday 21:15, at home, friends texting about plans. I’m in sweatpants, cheap candle lit. I feel cozy but also aware of what I’m missing.

pseudoprofile_context_ID058
Background: I work with my hands, so injury risk is always in my head. 06:10, workshop, cold concrete floor, gloves on. The machine noise is loud. I’m mentally scanning the day’s tasks and time pressure.

pseudoprofile_context_ID059
My neighborhood is lively at night, which I loved at first. Now 00:30, trying to sleep with street noise: laughter, footsteps, a scooter. I’m flipping the pillow to the cool side and trying to accept it.

pseudoprofile_context_ID060
Background: I grew up in a big family, so I’m used to sharing everything. Now I live alone, 15:00, and the quiet feels both peaceful and a bit empty. I’m making tea just to have a small ritual.

pseudoprofile_context_ID061
{AUTO_QUERY: weather(uv_index, sunlight_exposure_proxy)}
11:35, outside with bright sun. I’m squinting and wishing I brought sunglasses. I feel more awake in the light, but also slightly overstimulated. There’s construction noise nearby.

pseudoprofile_context_ID062
Background: I’ve been juggling two jobs for years, so my weeks are stitched together. Now 13:10, between shifts, sitting in a fast-food place because it’s warm and has Wi‑Fi. I’m charging my phone and eating quickly.

pseudoprofile_context_ID063
I’m in a new relationship, and we’re still learning each other’s rhythms. 22:05, at their place, sharing a blanket on the couch. I’m comfortable but also hyper-aware of little things (where to put my shoes, how loud I’m breathing).

pseudoprofile_context_ID064
Background: school was strict and mistake-focused, so I still triple-check. Now 10:15, sending an important email. I’ve reread it 7 times. My cursor hovers over “send” like it’s a cliff.

pseudoprofile_context_ID065
I’ve had long-term money stress, so I track everything. 09:30, bank app open, spreadsheet open. I’m categorizing purchases. It’s oddly soothing and exhausting at the same time.

pseudoprofile_context_ID066
Background: grew up in a hot climate, so cold gets into my bones. Now 07:05, bathroom tiles freezing, shower steaming. I’m warming my hands under water and trying to feel human again.

pseudoprofile_context_ID067
I’m caregiving for a toddler, so my “me time” is tiny. 06:50, the kid is finally watching a cartoon. I’m sipping coffee in the corner, trying not to make noise. My body feels tired in a deep way.

pseudoprofile_context_ID068
{AUTO_QUERY: weather(barometric_pressure, pressure_change_rate)}
16:00, headache-y afternoon. The sky is low and grey. My eyes feel sensitive to light even though it’s not bright. I’m moving slower and doing only essential tasks.

pseudoprofile_context_ID069
Background: I grew up in a home where emotions weren’t talked about, so I learned to “keep it together.” Now 18:45, on a call with a friend who’s sharing something heavy. I’m listening, but I can feel my own energy draining.

pseudoprofile_context_ID070
I live near a park, and it’s my main coping resource even if I don’t label it that. 16:25, walking under trees, hearing birds and distant traffic. I feel my breathing slow down. My phone is in my pocket on purpose.

pseudoprofile_context_ID071
Background: I’ve had to handle immigration/admin paperwork before, so I keep folders like a librarian. Now 08:55, government office, long line. Papers in my bag, I keep patting to check they’re there. The room is warm and crowded.

pseudoprofile_context_ID072
{AUTO_QUERY: location(place_type_guess); {AUTO_QUERY: noise_level_mic_proxy}?}
12:30, in a loud restaurant with coworkers. So many overlapping conversations. I’m smiling and nodding but my brain is working hard to track the right voice. I can feel a low-grade fatigue building.

pseudoprofile_context_ID073
Background: my childhood home was cluttered, so I crave order now. 14:10, cleaning day. I’m sorting a drawer and finding random old receipts. The “past” keeps showing up in objects. I’m trying to stay focused on the task.

pseudoprofile_context_ID074
I’ve been living with a chronic pain flare pattern for years, so I plan around “good windows.” 09:15, sitting at my desk with a heat pack. I’m trying to use this “okay” moment to get admin done before energy drops.

pseudoprofile_context_ID075
Background: I had a long-term remote job, so home became my workplace identity. Now 18:00, I’m trying to “end the day” but the laptop is still there. I’m walking from desk to couch like it’s a commute, trying to trick my brain.

pseudoprofile_context_ID076
{AUTO_QUERY: weather(temp); {AUTO_QUERY: pollen_count} if available}
10:40, outside, breezy. My nose is itchy and my eyes feel watery. I’m carrying tissues and trying not to look like I’m sick. Sun keeps going in and out behind clouds.

pseudoprofile_context_ID077
Background: I’m a first-gen migrant, so “small official letters” can still spike my attention. Now 11:05, mail in hand, standing in the hallway reading it twice. I’m translating in my head and checking dates.

pseudoprofile_context_ID078
I work in a customer-facing role, so my day is constant “hello.” 17:20, I’m finally in the staff room, shoes off. My face feels tired from smiling. I’m drinking water like I forgot how thirsty I was.

pseudoprofile_context_ID079
Background: I grew up in a religious community, so certain holidays still pull on me even if I’m not active now. Today is a holiday weekend, 19:40, I can hear celebrations outside. I’m indoors, half participating, half distant.

pseudoprofile_context_ID080
{AUTO_QUERY: device(notification_count_last_hour); {AUTO_QUERY: email_inflow_rate}}
08:50, workday start. Notifications are piling up before I’ve opened anything. My shoulders are high and I’m already doing micro-sighs. Coffee is still too hot to drink.

pseudoprofile_context_ID081
Background: I’ve had unstable housing before, so I notice safety features. Now 23:25, walking home, streetlights are patchy on my route. I’m choosing the brighter street even though it’s longer. Keys are in my fist.

pseudoprofile_context_ID082
I’m in a phase of trying to rebuild routines after a big life change. 07:00, making a simple breakfast. I’m keeping it basic on purpose. I feel proud of small structure, even though it’s tiny.

pseudoprofile_context_ID083
Background: I was raised with “don’t waste food,” so leftovers feel morally loaded. Now 12:10, staring into the fridge deciding what to eat. I’m hungry but indecisive. The kitchen is cold and quiet.

pseudoprofile_context_ID084
I have a long-term tendency to overbook myself, so my week is full before it starts. 15:55, looking at my calendar and realizing there’s no gap. I’m at my desk, sunlight fading. I’m weighing which obligation to drop.

pseudoprofile_context_ID085
{AUTO_QUERY: travel_status(timezone_offset_change, jetlag_likelihood)}
06:30, airport gate. I slept badly, neck stiff. Announcements echo, suitcase wheels everywhere. I keep checking my passport pocket. The light is harsh and my brain feels slow.

pseudoprofile_context_ID086
Background: I grew up in a house with thin walls, so I learned to be quiet. Now I live alone, 01:10, and I still tiptoe to the bathroom. It’s like my body kept that rule.

pseudoprofile_context_ID087
I’m on a tight heating budget, so winter means living in layers. 20:15, at home in a hoodie and socks, kettle running as “heat.” I’m staying in one room to conserve warmth. My hands are dry from cold air.

pseudoprofile_context_ID088
Background: I’ve been in therapy before, so I keep “tools” around without thinking about it. Now 13:35, I’m sitting on the floor doing slow breathing for two minutes before going back to email. It’s like a tiny reset button.

pseudoprofile_context_ID089
I live with someone who works nights, so the household schedule is misaligned. 11:00, I’m trying to be quiet while they sleep. I’m typing softly, closing doors slowly, moving like a cat in my own home.

pseudoprofile_context_ID090
{AUTO_QUERY: weather(extreme_heat_indicator, humidity)}
14:25, it’s hot and sticky. I’m in a crowded shop, air feels thick. I’m sweating and my patience is low. I’m trying to finish quickly and get outside into moving air.

pseudoprofile_context_ID091
Background: grew up with a parent who worried a lot, so my default is “scan for problems.” Now 18:30, I’m cooking and also checking my phone for updates about a delayed delivery. My attention is split between stove, timer, notifications.

pseudoprofile_context_ID092
I’m in a new job, so everything still feels “first day-ish.” 09:15, standing by the coffee machine, not sure where to stand or what to say. I’m holding my mug like a prop.

pseudoprofile_context_ID093
Background: I’ve had periods without reliable internet, so I still fear being disconnected. Now 19:50, router is blinking red. I’m refreshing pages, turning it off/on, feeling oddly urgent like my world shrinks without Wi‑Fi.

pseudoprofile_context_ID094
{AUTO_QUERY: weather(thunderstorm_indicator); {AUTO_QUERY: noise_level_proxy}}
22:40, storm outside. Thunder rolls and windows rattle. I’m on the couch with a blanket, lights low. I feel small but also kind of cozy, like the world is paused.

pseudoprofile_context_ID095
Background: I grew up sharing a room, so I’m used to other people’s rhythms. Now 23:05, partner asleep next to me. I’m trying not to move. I can hear their breathing and the clock ticking. My own thoughts feel louder than the room.

pseudoprofile_context_ID096
I’ve been managing a long-term health schedule (appointments, refills), so my week is structured by “care tasks.” 10:30, pharmacy + clinic day. I’m carrying a folder, water bottle, snacks. I’m tired before anything even happens.

pseudoprofile_context_ID097
Background: I’m from a family that values “being helpful,” so I say yes too fast. Now 16:15, someone asked me for “a quick favor” at work. I agreed. I’m staring at my to-do list realizing the cost.

pseudoprofile_context_ID098
{AUTO_QUERY: location(distance_to_home, distance_to_healthcare)}
08:05, walking in a neighborhood I don’t know well. I’m following maps, looking up at street signs. I’m aware of exits, cafés, places to duck into if I get lost. It’s a mix of curiosity and vigilance.

pseudoprofile_context_ID099
Background: I’ve lived through a couple of big transitions (move, breakup, job change), so my life still feels “in flux.” Now 12:55, sitting on a moving box eating lunch. Half the room is empty, half is clutter. I feel both free and unsettled.

pseudoprofile_context_ID100
I grew up in a home where people didn’t talk about money, so I had to learn it late. Right now 17:10, kitchen table, laptop open with budgeting tabs. Calculator app open. I’m trying to be practical: list, categorize, decide. Outside it’s getting dark and the room light feels harsher as the day ends.
