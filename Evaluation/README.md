# Evaluation Directory

This directory stores pseudoprofiles, intermediate evaluation artifacts, integrated run outputs, QA tests, and research communication reports.

## Core Folders

- `00_pipeline_orchestration/`
  - End-to-end orchestration entrypoints (`run_pipeline.py`, `run_pseudodata_to_impact.py`).
- `01_pseudoprofile(s)/`
  - Free-text and pseudodata sources.
- `02_mental_health_issue_operationalization/`
  - Complaint-to-criterion mapping outputs.
- `03_construction_initial_observation_model/`
  - Initial observation model construction artifacts.
- `04_initial_observation_analysis/`
  - Legacy/manual readiness, network, and impact outputs.
- `05_integrated_pipeline_runs/`
  - New standardized run-scoped outputs generated by the integrated orchestrator.
- `06_quality_assurance/`
  - Research-grade `pytest` test framework (unit + integration + smoke markers).
- `07_research_communication/`
  - Scripts for communication-ready reporting of integrated runs.

## Sequential Thesis Flow (Current Development Scope)

1. `01_pseudoprofile(s)` → pseudodata + free-text inputs
2. `04_initial_observation_analysis/00_readiness_check` (or run-scoped equivalent)
3. `04_initial_observation_analysis/01_time_series_analysis/network` (or run-scoped equivalent)
4. `04_initial_observation_analysis/02_momentary_impact_coefficients` (or run-scoped equivalent)
5. `05_integrated_pipeline_runs/<run_id>/03_treatment_target_handoff`
6. `05_integrated_pipeline_runs/<run_id>/04_impact_visualizations`
7. `05_integrated_pipeline_runs/<run_id>/05_research_reports`

## Integration Output Convention

Each run in `05_integrated_pipeline_runs/` follows:

- `00_readiness_check/`
- `01_time_series_analysis/network/`
- `02_momentary_impact_coefficients/`
- `03_treatment_target_handoff/`
- `04_impact_visualizations/`
- `05_research_reports/`
- `logs/`
- `pipeline_summary.json`
