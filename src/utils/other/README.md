# `utils/other`

This folder contains non-core utilities, exploratory scripts, and prototype tooling that support development outside the main thesis pipeline.

## Subfolders

- `exploratory/`  
  General experimental utilities (ontology summarization, diagnostics, early tests).

- `temporal_llm_experiments/`  
  Open-source LLM and temporal experimentation scripts.

- `generate_criteria/`  
  Auxiliary criteria-generation helpers.

## Backward Compatibility

Legacy aliases are kept so older script paths continue to work:

- `other -> exploratory`
- `tempo -> temporal_llm_experiments`
