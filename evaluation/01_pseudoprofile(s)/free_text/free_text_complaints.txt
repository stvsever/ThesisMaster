I keep waking up already tired. Like I slept 8 hours but it feels like I did a night shift anyway. My head is foggy all day, I forget why I walked into a room, and then I get mad at myself and spiral into “what’s wrong with me.”

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID002
I’ve been “fine” on the outside but I’m basically running on autopilot. Work, groceries, gym, repeat. Nothing is awful, but nothing feels good either. Even when something nice happens I’m like… ok? and then I feel guilty for not enjoying it.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID003
I get these random waves of panic where my chest feels tight and I’m convinced I’m about to faint in public. It’s embarrassing because people will be talking normally and I’m suddenly checking my pulse and planning my escape route.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID004
I’m snapping at my partner over stupid stuff (dishes, tone of voice, whatever) and then later I’m crying in the bathroom because I don’t even recognize myself. I don’t want to be mean but it’s like my patience is gone.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID005
Since my grandma died I feel weirdly numb, like I’m watching my own life from the outside. I’ll be ok for a minute and then a smell or a song hits and I’m wrecked. People keep telling me “time heals” and I’m like… cool, but I still can’t focus at work.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID006
My brain will not shut up at night. I replay conversations from years ago like they’re brand new, and I make lists in my head of everything that could go wrong tomorrow. Then I finally fall asleep at 3am and hate everyone at 8am.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID007
I can’t tell if I’m lazy or if something’s actually off. I sit down to do one small task and suddenly it’s two hours later and I’ve reorganized my photos, watched random videos, and still haven’t started. Then I panic because deadlines exist.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID008
I’m constantly tense in my shoulders and jaw. I don’t even notice until I get a headache. It feels like I’m bracing for something bad all the time, even on days that are supposed to be chill.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID009
I avoid social stuff because I’m convinced I’m annoying. I’ll say one thing in a group and then my brain goes “why did you say that??” for the next 48 hours. So I cancel plans, feel lonely, and then feel dumb for being lonely.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID010
Some days I’m super up and I start 10 new projects, talk a lot, spend money I shouldn’t, and I’m like “finally, I’m back!” Then a few days later I crash and can barely reply to texts. It’s exhausting and it’s messing with my routines.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID011
I keep checking the door is locked. Like I KNOW I locked it, I watched my hand do it, but my brain doesn’t accept it. I’ll go back 3–4 times and then I’m late and embarrassed and annoyed at myself.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID012
Food is becoming a whole thing. I’m either not hungry at all or I’m suddenly eating everything in the kitchen at midnight. After that I feel gross and I promise myself I’ll “be good tomorrow,” which just makes it worse.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID013
I’m drinking more than I planned. It started as “just to relax” after work, but now I notice I’m counting the hours until I can pour a glass. Mornings feel heavier, and I’m worried because it doesn’t feel like a choice sometimes.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID014
After I got yelled at by my boss in front of everyone, I can’t stop thinking about it. Even small feedback makes my stomach drop like I’m about to be humiliated again. I keep imagining the scene on repeat, like my brain is stuck on that clip.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID015
I don’t feel like myself since having the baby. I love my kid, but I also feel trapped and guilty and overwhelmed. I cry over tiny things and then I feel like a bad parent for crying. People keep saying it’s “normal” but I’m not ok.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID016
My body keeps freaking out for no clear reason: stomach cramps, nausea, heart racing, random dizziness. I’ve had tests and they say I’m “fine,” which is honestly annoying because it doesn’t FEEL fine. It makes me scared to go far from home.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID017
I’m burnt out but I can’t really stop. If I take a day off, I spend it feeling guilty and checking emails anyway. I don’t even remember the last time I felt rested. My friends say “just set boundaries” like it’s a switch.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID018
I keep getting hit with this empty, heavy feeling in the evenings. I’m not crying, I’m not having a breakdown, it’s just… bleak. I scroll on my phone for hours because doing anything else feels like climbing a mountain.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID019
I’m weirdly jumpy lately. A loud noise or someone walking behind me and I flinch hard. I had a bad incident last year and I thought I was over it, but my body clearly didn’t get the memo. I hate feeling on edge all the time.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID020
I feel like everyone else got the instruction manual and I missed it. I can function, but it’s like I’m constantly behind—money, chores, friendships, health. I’m always trying to catch up, and it makes me feel like I’m failing at a normal life.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID021
My sleep is messy in a different way: I fall asleep fine but I wake up at 4:30 and my brain is instantly ON. I try to “rest” but it turns into doomscrolling and then I’m wrecked by lunchtime.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID022
I keep getting these headaches that feel like someone is squeezing my skull, and when they happen my mood goes straight to zero. I cancel plans and then feel guilty and isolated, and it becomes this cycle of pain + shame.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID023
I’m constantly worrying about money even when I’m doing “ok.” One surprise bill and I feel like my whole life will collapse. I’m tired of living in this low-level panic about rent, groceries, and the future.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID024
I can’t handle noisy places anymore. Supermarkets, busy cafés, even family dinners—my brain gets overwhelmed and I just want to leave. People think I’m being dramatic but it feels like my nerves are on fire.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID025
I’m stuck in a loop of comparing myself to everyone. If a friend gets a promotion I’m happy for them for 2 seconds and then I feel like a failure. It’s ugly and I don’t want to be this jealous person.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID026
I keep rereading messages before I send them like 20 times. I’m terrified of sounding stupid or rude. It takes me forever to reply to anyone and then people think I’m ignoring them.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID027
My motivation is gone but my anxiety is high, so I just sit there feeling awful. Like I can’t start tasks because I’m stressed, but I’m stressed because I can’t start tasks. Great system.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID028
I had a mild concussion months ago and since then my concentration is trash. Screens make me nauseous, and I get irritable really fast. I’m scared this is just my brain now.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID029
I feel guilty when I rest. Like if I’m not productive I’m “wasting time” and falling behind. Even on weekends my mind is yelling at me to do something useful.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID030
Sometimes I get this unreal feeling like I’m in a movie and everything is slightly off. It usually happens when I’m stressed, and it freaks me out because it feels like I’m not fully here.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID031
I get these sudden anger spikes that surprise me. Like something minor happens—someone cuts me off in traffic—and I feel rage in my whole body. Then I’m ashamed because that’s not who I want to be.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID032
I’m sick of being “the strong one.” Everyone comes to me with their problems, but when I’m not ok I don’t know how to ask for help. I just swallow it and smile and then crash later.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID033
My appetite is weird. I forget to eat all day and then at night I’m starving and make bad choices. I’m not trying to diet or anything, it’s just like my hunger signals are broken.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID034
I have chronic back pain and it’s messing with my head. When it flares up, I start thinking “this will never end” and I get really low and irritable. It’s hard to be optimistic when your body hurts all the time.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID035
I’m anxious about my health in a way that feels out of control. A small symptom and I’m googling for hours, convinced I’m dying. I know it’s irrational but I can’t stop.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID036
I keep zoning out in conversations. People are talking and I’m nodding but my brain is somewhere else. Then I miss key things and feel stupid and embarrassed.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID037
I’m constantly late even when I try not to be. I underestimate everything—showering, finding my keys, walking to the car. Then I feel like a mess of a person.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID038
I can’t stop thinking about climate stuff and politics and basically the world falling apart. It’s like a background dread that makes it hard to plan anything long-term.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID039
I’m having relationship doubts but I can’t tell if it’s real issues or my own mood. Some days I feel love, other days I feel nothing and then I panic that I’m broken.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID040
My migraines are ruining my life. I can’t commit to plans because I never know if I’ll get hit with one. The unpredictability makes me anxious, and the anxiety probably makes the migraines worse. Cute.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID041
I keep waking up from nightmares that feel too real. Not every night, but enough that I’m scared to go to sleep. I wake up sweaty and my heart racing and it takes me ages to calm down.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID042
I’m working from home and I’m lonely in a way I didn’t expect. Days go by where my only face-to-face interaction is the cashier. I feel like I’m shrinking socially.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID043
I feel like my brain is full of bees. Thoughts buzzing, never quiet, always jumping. Even when I’m watching a show I’m also thinking about 5 other things.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID044
I get stuck on “what if” scenarios. What if I lose my job, what if my partner leaves, what if I get sick. It’s like my mind is trying to prepare but it just makes me miserable.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID045
I keep making small mistakes at work and it makes me panic that I’m going to get fired. Then I overcompensate and work late, and then I’m more tired and make more mistakes.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID046
I have this weird thing with textures and sounds lately. Certain chewing noises make me irrationally angry. I hate that I’m like this but I can’t un-hear it.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID047
Ifeel like I don’t belong anywhere. At work I’m the “weird one,” with friends I’m the “quiet one,” with family I’m the “disappointment.” I’m tired of wearing masks.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID048
I’m grieving a breakup but it’s not the dramatic crying kind; it’s more like a constant ache. I keep checking their socials and then I feel sick and embarrassed about myself.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID049
I’ve been having tingling in my hands/feet (doctor says maybe nerve stuff) and it freaks me out. When it happens I get anxious, and then the tingling gets worse. It’s like my body and brain are teamed up against me.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID050
I keep forgetting words mid-sentence and it makes me feel old and scared. Like I’ll be talking and suddenly my brain blanks on a normal word. Then I get self-conscious and talk less.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID051
I feel “behind” in life. Everyone is buying houses, having kids, traveling, and I’m like… trying to keep my plants alive. I know comparison is bad but it still hits.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID052
My stomach is a mess when I’m stressed. I get diarrhea before meetings and it’s humiliating. It makes me avoid stuff, which makes me more stressed. Again: great loop.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID053
I can’t stop picking at my skin when I’m anxious. I tell myself I’ll stop but I don’t notice until it’s too late and then I feel gross and ashamed.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID054
I’m scared I’m losing my creativity. I used to make music/draw and now the idea of starting feels heavy. Like I can’t access that part of me anymore.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID055
I’m caring for my mom and I’m drowning. I love her but I’m exhausted, and I feel guilty even typing that. I’m irritated all the time and then I hate myself for being irritated.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID056
I get this “surge” feeling in my chest when I try to relax. Like my body doesn’t trust calm. I’ll sit down and suddenly I’m restless and pacing like something bad is about to happen.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID057
I’m always “on” socially at work and then I get home and I’m dead inside. I can’t answer friends, I can’t make plans, I just stare at a wall or my phone.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID058
I’m stuck in a job I hate because bills, but thinking about changing jobs makes me panic too. I feel trapped either way.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID059
I feel like my memory is worse since I had COVID. I forget appointments, names, what I read 10 minutes ago. It makes me anxious and then I can’t focus at all.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID060
Sometimes I get intrusive thoughts that scare me, like random images of accidents happening. I don’t want them, I’m not trying to think them, they just pop in and I feel awful.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID061
I’m not depressed exactly, but I’m not excited about anything either. Even my hobbies feel like chores. I miss feeling genuinely interested in stuff.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID062
I feel like I’m always performing. Even with close friends I’m thinking “am I being fun enough?” and it’s exhausting. I want to be myself but I don’t even know what that is.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID063
I keep waking up with my jaw clenched and my teeth hurt. Dentist said it’s stress. Cool cool, love that my stress is literally grinding my face.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID064
I have chronic pelvic pain and it makes me anxious about intimacy. I worry my partner thinks I’m rejecting them. Then I feel pressure, and the pain gets worse. It’s like no win.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID065
I’m scared of driving after a car accident last year. People think I should be “over it” but my hands shake on the steering wheel and I keep seeing the crash in my head.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID066
I’m in a new city and I thought it would be exciting, but I feel disconnected. Making friends as an adult is hard and I feel stupid for struggling with it.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID067
I keep procrastinating on important stuff like taxes and emails and then it turns into this big monster in my head. The shame is almost worse than the task.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID068
I get random crying spells. Not like sobbing, just tears out of nowhere while doing dishes. It’s confusing and I feel broken.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID069
I’m exhausted from being the peacekeeper in my family. One wrong word and it turns into drama. I dread visits and then feel guilty for dreading them.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID070
I feel like my phone has wrecked my attention. I can’t read more than a page without checking something. Then I feel dumb and lazy and mad at myself.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID071
I’m having weird “electric shock” feelings sometimes (neuro said could be nerves). It scares me and I get hyperaware of my body. Then everything feels amplified.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID072
I keep thinking people secretly don’t like me. If someone doesn’t respond quickly I assume I did something wrong. It’s exhausting being this insecure.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID073
I’m angry about my past and I don’t know where to put it. Childhood stuff I thought I was past, but it keeps showing up in my reactions now.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID074
I can’t relax in silence. I need podcasts, music, TV. If it’s quiet my brain starts picking at every regret and fear. I wish I could just… be.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID075
I’m in constant low-level pain (neck/shoulders) and it makes me irritable and short with everyone. Then I feel like a bad person.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID076
I keep waking up to pee like 3 times a night and then I can’t fall back asleep. Next day I’m cranky and anxious. My sleep is sabotaging my life.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID077
I feel guilty for not calling my friends back but I also feel overwhelmed by the idea of talking. So I avoid, and then I feel lonelier.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID078
Sometimes I get a weird sense that time is slipping away and I’m wasting my life. Like existential panic out of nowhere: what am I doing, what’s the point, am I just working until I die?

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID079
My mood is super sensitive to my cycle. A few days a month I feel like my brain turns dark and everything feels hopeless, then it lifts and I’m like… why was I like that?

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID080
I had a scary medical situation in the hospital and now I get anxious even walking past that building. My body remembers the beeping and the lights. It sounds dramatic but it’s real.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID081
I’m obsessed with getting “everything right.” If I can’t do a task perfectly I’d rather not start. It sounds silly but it’s wrecking my life.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID082
I can’t stop rehashing arguments. I’ll replay what I should’ve said, what they meant, what it says about me. It’s like my brain wants closure but never gets it.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID083
I feel like I’m faking adulthood. I’m paying bills and showing up, but inside I feel like a scared kid who’s about to be found out.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID084
I’ve been having these “blank” moments where my mind goes empty and I can’t think for a few seconds. It freaks me out and then I get anxious that it’ll happen again.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID085
I have chronic fatigue and people don’t get it. They think I’m lazy because I’m always tired. I miss plans and then I lose friends and then I’m sad AND tired.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID086
I keep starting and quitting therapy apps/habits. I’ll do it for a week, feel hopeful, then miss a day and decide I’ve failed and drop it completely.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID087
My partner says I’m emotionally distant lately. I don’t mean to be. I just feel numb and it’s like I can’t access feelings when I’m supposed to.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID088
I’m scared of being alone but I’m also scared of being close. Dating makes me anxious, but so does the idea of never finding someone. It’s like my brain is stuck.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID089
I got promoted and instead of being proud I’m terrified. I feel like an impostor and I’m waiting for someone to notice I’m not that competent.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID090
I’m having trouble with intimacy because my mind races during it. I’m in my head judging everything. It’s like I can’t be present.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID091
My tinnitus (ringing in ears) is driving me nuts. At night it’s loud and it makes me anxious and then I can’t sleep. Then I’m irritable all day.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID092
I keep getting angry at myself for small mistakes. Like I spill coffee and my inner voice is brutal. I wouldn’t talk to anyone else like that.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID093
I feel like my friendships are shallow. We send memes but no one really knows me. When I try to be honest I feel awkward, so I shut down.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID094
I’m going through a divorce and I feel like I’m grieving a person who’s still alive. People say “you’ll be happier” but right now I just feel hollow and stressed.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID095
I have nerve pain in my leg that flares randomly, and when it hits I get this fear like “what if it gets worse forever.” I hate how quickly my mind goes catastrophic.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID096
I keep forgetting to take my meds/supplements/whatever I’m supposed to do. I set alarms, I ignore them, then I feel ashamed. I’m tired of being unreliable to myself.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID097
I’m scared to check my bank account. I avoid it, then I get hit with fees, then I feel worse. Avoidance is ruining me financially and mentally.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID098
I feel like I’m always “too much” or “not enough.” Too emotional, too quiet, too needy, not successful enough. I don’t know how to just be ok with myself.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID099
My sleep schedule is chaos. I stay up late because it’s the only time I feel like I have control, then I’m miserable the next day. But I keep doing it anyway.

pseudoprofile_FTC_ID100
After a stressful few weeks my neck pain flared and I started getting arm numbness, and now I’m anxious every time I feel a twinge. I’m tired of my body setting off alarm bells all day.
