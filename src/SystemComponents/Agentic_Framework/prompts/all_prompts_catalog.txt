PHOENIX Prompt Catalog
======================

Purpose
-------
This file is a single aggregated prompt index for the PHOENIX agentic runtime.
It centralizes all active Step-02/03/04/05 actor and critic prompts in one place.

Active prompt files
-------------------
- step02_initial_model_system.md
- step02_initial_model_user_template.md
- step02_initial_model_critic_system.md
- step02_initial_model_critic_user_template.md
- step03_target_selection_system.md
- step03_target_selection_user_template.md
- step03_target_selection_critic_system.md
- step03_target_selection_critic_user_template.md
- step04_observation_update_system.md
- step04_observation_update_user_template.md
- step04_observation_update_critic_system.md
- step04_observation_update_critic_user_template.md
- step05_hapa_intervention_system.md
- step05_hapa_intervention_user_template.md
- step05_hapa_intervention_critic_system.md
- step05_hapa_intervention_critic_user_template.md

Prompt contract policy
----------------------
1) Every prompt must explicitly state it is part of PHOENIX:
   Personalized Hierarchical Optimization Engine for Navigating Insightful eXplorations.
2) Actor prompts optimize outputs for stage goals.
3) Critic prompts score outputs with weighted multi-composite quality metrics.
4) Critic feedback must be actionable and consumed by actor revision loops (max 2 iterations).
5) Schema compliance is mandatory for all structured outputs.

Notes
-----
- Prompt activation and versioning is controlled by prompts_manifest.json.
- Legacy inline prompts are tracked in full_engine_prompt_inventory.md.
